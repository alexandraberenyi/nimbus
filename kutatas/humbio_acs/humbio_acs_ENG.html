        <span class="darkgreen"> Human biometeorology </span>
        investigates the relationship between humans and the atmosphere. A person is 
        characterized by his clothing and activity, the air environment can be outdoor or
        indoor. In what follows, we look at an outdoor person.
      </p>
      <p>
        The air environment of a person outside varies greatly; this variability can be 
        characterized on the space-time scale of climate and weather. A person's clothing 
        can be appropriate for the summer (minimum) or winter (maximum) season, their 
        activity can change, for instance, one can lie down, stand, walk or run (other 
        activity types are also possible). We assume that the person is in good health.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="darkgreen"> Data collection: </span>
        the human-atmosphere relationship is characterized by data, by linking data on 
        humans and the atmosphere. We are mostly interested in the thermal load of the
         air environment and the thermal perception of people in it. There are two data 
         collection methods: longitudinal and transversal data collection. In the case of 
         longitudinal data collection, 1 person collects weather data over as long a period 
         as possible to create the longest possible time series (the length of the time 
         series is equal to the number of weather observations). When collecting transversal 
         data, many people provide information about themselves in the current weather 
         situation. In this case too, the goal is to make the time series as long as possible 
         (the length of the time series is equal to the number of people). 
      </p>
      <p>
        In this project, we carry out longitudinal data collection while simultaneously 
        documenting data gathered on the human participants and the weather. Among the weather 
        data, we document solar radiation (GR), air temperature (Ta), air humidity (rh), 
        wind speed (W) and cloudiness (N). With regard to human data, the following are 
        captured: anthropometric data (body mass, body length, age, sex), thermal perception 
        (seven-level scale: "very warm", "warm", "slightly warm", "neutral", "cool", "cold" 
        and "very cold”), the clothing worn and the type and intensity of the activity. 
        Longitudinal observations began in the summer of 2016 and have been carried out 
        continuosuly to this day. The person conducting the observation is Dr. Ferenc Ács. 
        We can report on the following data collections:

        <span class="darkgreen">Modeling:</span>
        Recently, energy balance-based models are the most widespread 
        (Pochter et al., 2018). The main advantage of these models is 
        that they can also simulate the effect of human factors on thermal 
        load. The energy balance equation can be used in two ways. The usual 
        procedure is to calculate skin surface and/or clothing surface temperatures 
        based on knowledge of activity (metabolic heat flow density) and 
        clothing worn (thermal resistance of clothing). This is the so-called 
        „forward” procedure. The other method calculates the thermal resistance 
        of the clothing and/or the evaporative resistance of the skin surface 
        based on the knowledge of the activity and the temperature of the skin 
        surface. This is the so-called „backward” procedure. Models using the 
        "backward" process are also called inverse "forward" models (briefly 
        inverse models). In human biometeorology, traditional „forward” models 
        are much more widespread than inverse models (de Freitas and Grigorieva, 2015). 
      </p>
      <p>
        The thermal load is estimated based on running our own inverse models. 
        The environmental heat deficit is simulated with a clothing thermal resistance 
        (rcl) model (briefly clothing index model), which estimates the rcl 
        (m2·℃/W) value that exists in the case of energy balance. The environmental 
        heat surplus is simulated with a skin evaporative   resistance (rskin) model,
         which calculates the rskin (m2·hPa/W) value ensuring the energy balance at 
         the human body-environment interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="darkgreen">Weather analysis:</span>
        Weather can also be analyzed from the point of view of human thermal load and 
        thermal perception. We may hear such remarks during the announcement of the
         weather, but this important aspect is not highlighted and evaluated. To fill 
         this gap, we conduct longitudinal observations for the following weather conditions.
